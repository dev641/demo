              <p>
                How could bespoke wardrobes help you? Well, for those of us
                living in the Capital storage can be a tricky subject when it’s
                not already built in to your home.

                Period properties don’t tend to have storage solutions in most
                rooms and modern flats vary in their design - some ensuring
                there is enough built-in storage space and others much less.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve found that many people moving into a new-build home have
                in-built wardrobes in their bedrooms but these often take the
                form of a large partition wall and a set of doors which don’t
                have shelves, cupboards or drawers tailored to your needs – just
                a big empty shell. Also you’d be surprised by the fact that
                often the doors don’t actually help you maximise the space all
                the way to the ceiling and instead cut off much lower than the
                actual accessible space of the wardrobe – we often have clients
                asking us to knock this top part out so we can create a useful
                cupboard.
              </p>
              <p>
                Generally these new-build fitted wardrobes are not suited to the
                individual’s needs so with a bespoke wardrobe you can discover a
                new level of organisation and efficiency in your bedroom!
              </p>
              <p>
                Now there is always the design-it-yourself wardrobe from our
                blue and yellow Swedish cousins or that lovely one you saw in
                one of the major high street brands but there is still the fact
                that they can’t always perfectly fit your space and maximise the
                potential of your rooms.

                <h2>Custom Fitted Wardrobes</h2>
                <p>
                  In London space is at a premium - this is the benefit of
                  hand-made, built-in furniture - we can take advantage of every
                  odd space, nook and cranny, making the best piece of furniture
                  by utilizing every little bit of your room. Whereas a pre-made
                  wardrobe can’t fit flush to your ceiling, accumulating dust
                  and nor can it close off those horrible gaps between the
                  wardrobe and the back wall, we can make the top and sides of
                  your wardrobe or storage unit millimetre-snug to the wall –
                  even if it is at an odd angle or bulges in the odd place. This
                  is how you can maximise your space.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Often people have trouble with storing their suitcases or
                  smaller bags and we find that in many cases when you have a
                  relatively high ceiling we can make the most of it by building
                  on higher level cupboards above the wardrobe hanging space
                  which can solve this and in a beautiful and subtle way as in
                  the next picture:
                </p>
                <img
                  class="big-image"
                  src="image/Traditional-wall-wall-wardrobe-with-eight-panel-style-doors.-Made-in-MDF-hand-painted-in-eggshell-paint.-Missing-ceiling-cornice.jpg"
                  alt=""
                />
                <p>
                  Then there is the fact that you can specify, to the
                  centimetre, the length of each hanging space – this for us
                  ladies is an important factor – long dresses and coats are
                  often brushing the floor of some wardrobes or even having to
                  be folded up on a hanger in order to fit - sometimes even with
                  pegs to hold them in place!
                </p>
                <h2>The Sky is the Limit</h2>
                <p>
                  With built-in wardrobes you can choose whatever length of
                  hanging space you want. You can have a single rail,
                  double-rail, long or short hanging spaces, pull-down hanging
                  racks, shelves on the very bottom or splitting the space into
                  two sections - with shelves on one side and a rail on the
                  other. If you don’t want any shelves you can reserve the
                  bottom space for drawers - the sky is the limit!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your bags can have their own shelf space, pull out tray or
                  even a drawer. Suitcases can have their own specified location
                  - usually in the top box. Then those other things that you
                  want out of sight and you are not going to need so frequently
                  can have a space made specifically for their use.
                </p>
                <h2>Truly Custom Wardrobes</h2>
                <p>
                  Then you can make the wardrobe flush to the wall – despite any
                  size of skirting board. This can allow us to reduce how far
                  the wardrobe sticks into your room. You can decide how
                  obtrusive or unobtrusive your wardrobe will be. But often just
                  the look of a flush-to-the-wall wardrobe looks unobtrusive as
                  it appears to be part of the room upon initial inspection.
                  Also by matching the paint colour of the wardrobe with your
                  walls you create a seamless feel and the appearance of more
                  space. Our in-house designer can accommodate for this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So that leads us to the fun part - colours and doors! You can
                  change the feel of a room with the outer look of your bespoke
                  wardrobe. Bespoke carpentry I always think looks high-end
                  whatever the finish but you can pick to your taste. If you
                  prefer the traditional look with panel doors style you can get
                  those but these can be simple or more complex depending if you
                  like the panel style with beading – and what kind of beading.
                  Then you can have glass inserts or mirrors affixed to your
                  doors. With bespoke furniture you are not limited in the range
                  of doors you can have.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then you have the colour of your room – you can do whatever
                  you like! The custom wardrobe can match the colour of the
                  walls of your room and blend in or it can stand out on its own
                  – bold colours that contrast with the rest of the room are
                  more and more popular.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So whether you want a statement piece or a more subtle piece
                  you can have it with a bespoke, fitted wardrobe.
